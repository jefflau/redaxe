# Redaxe

Redaxe is a simpler state container for your front-end applications. It is inspired by Redux's global state, but gets rid of the application separate of actions and reducers. Instead the 'Redaxe' way is to import your state directly into each component and whenever you want to update the state, you call the `update` function and give it the new state. When update is called, Redaxe automatically re-renders your application. Currently Redaxe works best with Immutable, however you can give it normal Javascript objects instead if you wish.

Redaxe can be used with any front-end that allows you to 'refresh' your application, but currently has only been tested in React.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save redaxe
```

## API

Redaxe is super simple and only has a few exports:

* update(newState) - function that takes your newState and updates the db
* db - your state for reading (Do not write directly to the db)

## Setting up with React

After you import the Redaxe class, you must instantiate it with at least two arguments. The first is the initial data for your application. This could be an empty object or an Immutable object. Redaxe makes no assumptions about your data, however we've it easier to use Immutable's database like API for deeply nested maps/objects.

The second is a function to

```js
//App.js

import React from 'react'
import RedaxeInit from 'redaxe'
import Main from './Main' //Root React Component

let initialData = {
  foo: bar,
}

RedaxeInit(
  Immutable.fromJS(initialData),
  () => ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById('root'))
)

```

You must run your RedaxeInit first before anything else or nothing will run. From there you can export Redaxe's base functions to start building your app. Redaxe will call your render function automatically on setup so you don't have to call it yourself.

## Adding middleware

Redax also supports middleware that takes the new state and can use it before the data has been updated to the database or rendered to the client. The third parameter is an array of the middleware functions. Here we can see a simple example with a logger function. You can add your own layer such as syncing data to localstorage.

```js
import React from 'react'
import RedaxeInit from 'redaxe'
import Main from './Main'
import { fromJS } from 'Immutable'

let initialData = {
  foo: bar,
}

function RedaxeImmutableLogger (state) {
  console.log('currentState')
  console.log(state.toJS())
  return state
}

let middleware = [RedaxeImmutableLogger]

RedaxeInit(
  Immutable.fromJS(initialData),
  () => ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById('root')),
  middleware
)

```

## Reading from the state

Reading state is easy as importing the app object. The data is saved under the `db` property of your app object. You could pass them through as props, but Redaxe will automatically re-render your app every time it updates so there is no need to use props.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { db } from 'redaxe'

//Immutable
const Component = () =>
  <div>{db.get('foo')}</div>


//Normal objects
const Component = () =>
  <div>{db.foo}</div>

```

## Writing to the state

Writing to the state is easy as well. Instead of mutating the object directly, you must call the `update` method and give it a new version of the state. If you mutate the state directly, then Redaxe will not call the render function for you and your app will not update.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { db, update } from 'redaxe'

//Immutable
function handleStateChange() {
  update(
    db.set('foo', 'barbar')
  )
}
//Normal Objects using spread operator
function handleStateChange() {
  update(
    {
      ...db,
      foo: 'barbar'
    }
  )
}

const Component = () =>
  <div>{db.get('foo')}</div>
  <button onClick={handleStateChange}>Change to bar</button>
```

## Abstracting updaters to a separate file

When your app becomes larger and you may end up reusing the same update functions over and over, you can abstract them into a separate file. In Redaxe we call them 'updaters' as they update the state. We will use immutable.js for the rest of these examples, but you could also use normal objects in the same way

```js
// updaters.js
import { db, update } from 'redaxe'
export function updateFoo(value){
  update(
    db.set('foo', value)
  )
}

// app.js
import React from 'react'
import { db } from 'redaxe'

//Immutable
function handleStateChange(value) {
  updateFoo(value)
}

const Component = () =>
  <div>{db.get('foo')}</div>
  <button onChange={(event) => handleStateChange(event.value)}>Change to bar</button>
```


## Abstraction to reducers to make things testable

For a small application you might want to do away with tests, and that's why Redaxe is flexible in the way you gradually abstract your updaters and handlers into different files. However when your app grows you can abstract your state reduction to a different function to make things testable. Now that we have abstracted

```js
// updaters.js
import { db, update } from 'redaxe'

export const updateFooReducer = (db, value) =>
  db.set('foo', value)

export function updateFoo(value){
  update(updateFooReducer(db, value))
}

//updaters.test.js using Jest

import { updateFooReducer } from './updaters'
import { fromJS } from 'immutable'

test('fooReducer', () => {
  let db = fromJS({
    foo: 'bar'
  })
  expect(updateFooReducer(db, 'barbar')).toBe(fromJS({
    foo: 'barbar'
  }))
})

// app.js
import React from 'react'
import { db } from 'redaxe'
import { updateFoo } from './updaters'

function handleStateChange(value) {
  updateFoo(value)
}

const Component = () =>
  <div>{db.get('foo')}</div>
  <button onChange={(event) => handleStateChange(event.value)}>Change to bar</button>
```
